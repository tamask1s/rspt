 Fast Walsh Hadamard Transform

 The input souce has to be in size 2^n.

 Example use: You have two similar images where the camera
 is moved or rotated slightly and you want to find the
 transformation of the camera movement. You then take
 two 4x4 pieces of each image and transform each color channel
 with FWHT and then take the differences, sum them
 and you will have a number that tells you how similar the
 two pieces are.

 When you apply a FWHT twice, you get the same as before,
 only multiplied with a factor of the size of the data.
